# Trajectory & Consensus Error 

## 1. Y–axis Consensus

### Files in this folder

- `all_drones_y_vs_time.eps` – Y-position trajectories of all Agent's and Follwer's over time  
  ![All drones: y vs time](./all_drones_x_vs_time.eps)

- `y_consensus_error_vs_time.eps` – Per-Agent absolute error to the **y-consensus** value  
  ![Consensus error in y](./y_consensus_error_vs_time.eps)

### Plots description

#### All-creazyfiles overlay: `y` vs `Time(s)`
- Each curve is a agent’s **y(t)**.
- Labels: `A1…A5` are agent's; `T1/T2` are Follwer's.
- Colors/linestyles come from the script’s `STYLE_MAP`.
- Convergence (lines converging together) hints at consensus along the y-axis.


## 2. X–axis Consensus

### Files in this folder

- `all_drones_x_vs_time.eps` – X-position trajectories of all Agent's and Follwer's over time  
  ![All drones: x vs time](./all_drones_x_vs_time.eps)

- `x_consensus_error_vs_time.eps` – Per-Agent absolute error to the **x-consensus** value  
  ![Consensus error in x](./x_consensus_error_vs_time.eps)

### Plots description

#### All-creazyfiles overlay: `x` vs `Time(S)`
- Each curve is a agent’s **x(t)**.
- Labels: `A1…A5` are agent's; `T1/T2` are Follwer's.
- Colors/linestyles come from the script’s `STYLE_MAP`.
- Convergence (lines converging together) hints at consensus along the x-axis.
